## Problem Solving Pattern

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- MANY MORE ...

## p1 - Frequency Counter

- uses object or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- this can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings

## p2 - Multiple Pointers

- creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

## p3 - Sliding Window

- this pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
- depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
- very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

## p4 - Divide and Conquer

- this pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
- this pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity
