## Algorithm

- a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
- almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
- it's the foundation for being successful problem solving and developer
- INTERVIEW

- DEVISE a plan for solving problems
- MASTER common problem solving patterns

## STEP 1: Understand the Problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outpus that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

## STEP 2: Explore Concrete Examples

- Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
- examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

- start with simple example
- progress to more complex examples
- explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs

## STEP 3: Break It Down

- explicitly write out the steps you need to take

## STEP 4: Solve / Simplify

- Solve the problem. If you can't, solve a simpler problem!

- find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
- temporarily ignore the difficulty
- write a simplified solution
- then incorporate that difficulty back in

## STEP 5: Look Back and Refactor

- can you check the result?
- can you derive the result differently?
- can you understand it at a glance?
- can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- can you improve the performance of your solution?
- can you think of other ways to refactor?
- how have other people solved this problem?
