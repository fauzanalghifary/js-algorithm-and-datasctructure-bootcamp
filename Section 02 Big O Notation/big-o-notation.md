## WHY Big O Notation?

- Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same functions
- How can we determine which one is the "best" ?
- BIG O NOTATION!

## WHO cares?

- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
- Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
- Identifying inefficient code
- It comes up in interviews! (?)

## What Does Better Mean?

- Faster ?
- Less memory-intensive?
- More readable?

## The Problem with Time

- Different machines will record different times
- For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough

- Rather than counting seconds, LET'S count the NUMBER of simple operations the computer has to perform

## Big O

- how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow

- O(1) => No change
- O(n) => Linear
- O(n^2) => Quadratic
