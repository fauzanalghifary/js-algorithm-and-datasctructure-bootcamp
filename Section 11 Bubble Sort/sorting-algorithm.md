## Sorting Algorithm

- sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

  - number from smallest to largest
  - names alphabetically
  - movies based on release year
  - movies based on revenue

- sorting is a very common task, so it's good to know how it works
- there are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages

## Simpler Sorting Algorithm

- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort

- those are simpler sorting algorithms
- they don't perform as well as more advanced algorithms, but they are easier to understand

## More Advanced Sorting Algorithm

- merge sort
- quick sort
- radix sort

- those are more advanced sorting algorithms
- they are more complicated to implement, but they perform better than simpler algorithms
